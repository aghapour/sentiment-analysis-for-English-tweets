# sentiment-analysis-for-English-tweets
I implement a python code for sentiment analysis for English tweets. For this purpose I combine a lot of approaches with each other to get more accuracy. I wore two sample codes for using datasets, one of them use just in the LMS dataset and another one uses extra dataset furthermore LMS dataset, I will explain both of them. For running this two sample codes you need copy this dataset files to beside of my python code files or change the right file path from the code.
